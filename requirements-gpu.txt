# Ant Tracker - GPU Installation
# Use this if you have an NVIDIA graphics card for faster processing
# Requirements: NVIDIA GPU drivers and CUDA 11.8 installed on your system
#
# Compatible GPUs:
#   - NVIDIA RTX series (RTX 3060, 3070, 3080, 3090, 4070, 4080, 4090)
#   - NVIDIA GTX series (GTX 1660, 1080, etc.) - older but works
#   - Workstation GPUs (A100, V100, etc.) - best performance
#   - Minimum 6GB VRAM recommended, 8GB+ ideal
